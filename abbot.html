            <h1><strong> About MiGG </strong></h1>

            <p>
                My indie Game Gallery (MiGG) is a passion project dedicated to showcasing the wonders and fun 
                of the indie gaming space. In a world that often leans toward mainstream titles, it's easy for the 
                incredible work of small creators to be overlooked.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is my personal gallery of games I love, curated to prove a simple idea: games aren't just entertainment; 
                it's an experience. Additionally, a great game doesn't need a high budget to deliver a powerful experience. 
                Here, you'll find creative visuals, peculiar mechanics, and, most importantly, a wide variety of emotions and experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                My goal is to share a fresh perspective and bring fun to fellow players, while also supporting the 
                indie creators whose work I admire. Consider this website my love letter to their craft. This isn't a 
                store or a review site. It's a personal gallery of games that have surprised me, moved me, or just 
                given me a really good time. I hope this place helps you find your next favorite game and reminds 
                you why indie games are so special.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every game you see here is one I've played and personally vetted. This isn't a list generated by an 
                algorithm or a paid ad. If it's on MiGG, it's because I truly believe it's special and worth your time.
            </p>

            <h1><strong> A Quick Note on How I Pick Games </strong></h1>
            <br>

            <p>
                I handpicked every single game here based on the unique feelings they evoke and the memorable experiences they offer. 
                My main rule is simple: if a game stuck with me long after I finished playing — whether 
                because of its creativity, its heart, its narrative, or its sheer weirdness — then it belongs on MiGG. 
                This isn't about scores or popularity; it's about connecting with something genuinely different.
            </p>

            <h1><strong>What You'll Find Here</strong></h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                The games in MiGG are organized by the feelings and experiences they evoke, 
                not just traditional genres. Each category is filled with handpicked titles that perfectly capture that specific vibe. 
                Here's a guide to the categories you can explore:
